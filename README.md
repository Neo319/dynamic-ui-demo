Creating modules for commonplace elements in practical frontend web development.

## Installation

1. in the terminal command line, run the following: 

npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli eslint prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier html-webpack-plugin style-loader css-loader

This will allow dependencies to be installed for future projects.

2. Uncomment all lines from .gitignore, so that future projects can have these ignored by git.
